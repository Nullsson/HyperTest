# HyperTest
HyperTest is a small unit testing library built to be simple enough for someone

## Usage
HyperTest is based on the idea of [Unity Builds](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/847974/the-benefits-disadvantages-of-unity-builds) (not to be confused with the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/)). This means the user of HyperTest should preferably follow the conventions used to not worry about complications.

defines and declares a main() function to be ran so as a user of HyperTest...............
